What is possible?
I haven't always thought positive because I feel- well I know that I would mentally block myself from thinking ahead. I would always limit myself growing up and just would sort of be pessimistic with myself. I was hypocritical because with others and my friends, I would tell them that they can set their minds to do anything that they wanted to accomplish. Meanwhile me to myself I would limit. Now that I'm getting older, I have decided to challenge myself to think differently.Instead of thinking what can go wrong. I'm now challenging myself on what if? What if things go right?
