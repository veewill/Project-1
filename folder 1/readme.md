Who are you?
Hello, my name is Victoria, my nicknames are Vee and Vivi. I am 25. I like to sing and I'm currently teaching myself on how to play the bass guitar. I like drawing, listening to music, anime, tv dramas and I'm currently taking this program to learn how to code and hopefully become a web developer. I was going to school for social work, but I thought why not try and learn something new.
