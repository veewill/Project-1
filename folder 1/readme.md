Who are you?
My name is Victoria, but my nickname is Vee. I'm 25. I like to sing and I'm currently teaching myself on how to play bass guitar. I like drawing, listening to music, and I'm currently taking this program to learn how to code and hopefully become a web developer. I was going to school for social work, but I thought why not try and learn something new.
