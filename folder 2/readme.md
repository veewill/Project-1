What is something you know?
 guess I'm knowledgeable about small things about any subject enough to have a decent conversation with a person. Anything that I'm not knowledgeable about, I just ask questions or I try to educate myself more before continuing on. Something that I know is that I'm still a student in this journey called "life." I'm always learning something new everyday.
